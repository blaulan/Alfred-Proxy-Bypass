### [GET LATEST VERSION](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24603822/Proxy%20Bypass.alfredworkflow)

Alfred workflow to search and modify network proxy bypass list. The workflow won't verify any domain, so be prepared for errors if you type a wrong rule. And, you have to enter your password every time you modify network preference. 

Now the workflow can be updated via [Alleyoop 3](https://github.com/phyllisstein/Workflows/tree/master/Alleyoop%203).
